# Resale Price Prediction for Flats in Singapore

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The predictive model utilizes historical data of resale flat transactions to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Motivation
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, making it challenging to accurately estimate resale values. Factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration significantly influence resale prices. This project addresses these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.

## Scope
### Tasks:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) spanning from 1990 to Till Date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset and create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression and train it on the historical data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's predictive performance using regression metrics.
5. **Streamlit Web Application**: Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input flat details and predicts the resale price.
6. **Deployment on Render**: Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible over the internet.
7. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure functionality and accuracy.

### Deliverables:
- Well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
- User-friendly web application deployed on the Render platform.
- Documentation and instructions for using the application.
- Project report summarizing data analysis, model development, and deployment process.

## Results
This project benefits potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market by providing them with estimated resale prices. Buyers can make informed decisions, while sellers can gauge their flat's market value. Additionally, it showcases the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
